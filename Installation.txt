[ Installation Issues ]
-----------------------
If you are having issues installing or configuring this addon please contact me via the CoderHire ticketing
process or via steam (if you're on my friends list). I cannot offer to do free server installations, so I (Hans)
or another developer will install it on your server for a small fee.

There is a video installation at (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wiNK_MvEu4) but it's crappy & laggy, these
written instructions are preferred because they will remain updated through updates and such.

Note: Your web server must also include support for a few other things such as APC & cURL
